/**
Challenge: 

- Start building out the BoredBot Skeleton however you'd like. 
    That will include:
    - A title for the app ("BoredBot" might be a good start ðŸ˜‰)
    - A placeholder element that will be populated with the random 
      idea we get from the API
    - A button to click for triggering the GET request to the Bored API. 
      (Don't worry about implementing the button quite yet)
